## How to use for webmaster:

example: var url = "hflash://" + base64encode("http://yoursite.com/"+swfpath);

hints for webmaster:
* swfpath need not urlencode.
* modern browsers has built in base64encode function, just: btoa(swfpath) .
* if you open the launch url in a new window, it will leave a blank window, if not, the web page will stop functioning after launch. h-flash's solution: open in a hidden iframe.
