## How to use on all sites:

* we need a user script to add buttons on flash plugin objects.

1. install user script browser extension Tampermonkey.  
   chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo

## How to use for webmaster:

1. (optional) Edit Scheme property in Form1.cs for your custom scheme, then rebuild.
2. Combine scheme header with base64 encoded swf full path Â as a launch url.
example: var url = "hflash://" + base64encode("http://yoursite.com/"+swfpath);

hints for webmaster:
* swfpath need not urlencode.
* modern browsers has built in base64encode function, just: btoa(swfpath) .
* if you open the launch url in a new window, it will leave a blank window, if not, the web page will stop functioning after launch. h-flash's solution: open in a hidden iframe.
